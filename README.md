# To-Love-Roo

This repo is for a fun web app I built to test drive the MEVN stack. As a concept, it allows a sender to post messages to a recipient **(that only the recipient can see.)** If you have any suggestions or feedback as I continue to iterate and expand on this app while learning Vue.js, please feel free to reach out. I am always happy to collaborate or learn from my mistakes!
